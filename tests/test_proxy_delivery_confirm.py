"""Proxy delivery confirmation (UPG-PROXY-APPEND-BURNS-COOLDOWN + the audit
companion UPG-PROXY-AUDIT-CLAIMS-UNDELIVERED-INJECTION).

The defect these lock down: a real editor's FIRST request ends with a
`system`-role message, so `append_context_block` refuses it (deliberate
fail-open) — yet the retrieval that produced the block had already charged the
note's cooldown slot daemon-side, and the proxy's session id is
process-scoped, so the slot stayed spent for the life of the process. Requests
2..N WERE appendable and carried the file anchor, and were suppressed. The
durable audit log meanwhile recorded PROACTIVE_INJECT for every one of those
undelivered blocks.

The fix has two halves, and each has its own mutation check below:
  (a) decide appendability BEFORE spending a retrieval, so an unappendable
      request costs nothing and the note survives to the next request;
  (b) charge the cooldown ledger (and emit PROACTIVE_INJECT) on CONFIRMED
      delivery, carried back as an opaque token on the next call.

Every upstream call goes to an in-process mock; the daemon is the real
FastAPI app over an ASGI transport backed by a real memory-only VectrService.
Nothing here touches the network.
