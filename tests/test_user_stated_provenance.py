"""UPG-MEM-PROVENANCE-USER-STATED — the machine-checkable middle trust class.

A note that merely transcribes what the user said used to render with the
agent frame ("Memory to verify ... not human-endorsed"), understating it,
while an agent misremembering "the user said X" carried no frame at all. The
fix is deliberately NOT a new self-declared provenance value: an agent
asserting its own authority is the forgery `provenance="human"` is already
rejected for. It is a deterministic string check — a verbatim user excerpt
must actually be quoted inside the note's own content — and only that check
can mint the class.

Covered here: the binding function itself, the store's write-time behaviour
(bound, unbound/adversarial, human-wins, directive interaction, persistence),
the promotion ladder's treatment of a derived class, the rendered frame, and
both caller surfaces (MCP dispatch + REST route).
