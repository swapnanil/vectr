# Memory kinds (UPG-9.3). Mirrors the disk-memory split that makes CLAUDE.md
# (unconditional directives) distinct from MEMORY.md (relevance-ranked learnings):
#   directive — must-never-miss rules; injected unconditionally at SessionStart.
#   task      — current-work context; injected in the SessionStart boot set.
#   gotcha    — file/path-anchored caveats; injected at PreToolUse + semantic recall.
#   finding   — relevance-ranked learnings; injected per-prompt at UserPromptSubmit.
#   reference — pointers (URLs/tickets); surfaced on demand only.
#   decision  — an architectural/design decision plus its why (UPG-DECISION-
#               TIMELINE). NOT boot-privileged (no default trigger bundle, see
#               default_bundle_for_kind() in trigger_engine.py — same
#               evaluation-time bucket as finding/reference); accrues over a
#               project's life and is meant to be recalled as a group with
#               `vectr_recall(kind="decision", sort_by="chronological")`,
#               yielding an ADR-like decision timeline for free.
#   operational — an env/process/build fact (build quirks, CI gotchas,
#               feedback-loop knowledge) that is not anchored to a single code
#               file the way `gotcha` is (UPG-MEMORY-STATE-MACHINE §5.1).
#               Primary surface is prompt-time semantic matching
#               (UserPromptSubmit, embeddings only); a secondary PreToolUse
#               command-family surface is opt-in via an explicit `triggers[]`
#               override (§5.2). Always carries a last-confirmed/drift verdict
#               (§4.4) rather than the plain provenance framing other kinds get.

# Trigger engine wave 1 (TRIGGER-ENGINE, bm2-design-skeleton.md §2/§5) — closed
# protocol vocabularies, not tunable thresholds, so these live beside VALID_KINDS
# as plain constants rather than in config.yaml (same reasoning as VALID_KINDS
# itself: a caller either uses one of these values or the write is rejected;
# there is nothing here for an operator to retune).
#
# EVENT_VALUES: the E trigger primitive's enum. Every value is a real lifecycle
# moment; none has a live hook caller into fire()/evaluate_note() yet this wave
# (see agent/trigger_engine.py's module docstring for the exact wiring status)
# — an event with no live caller is simply never evaluated, never an error

# SCOPE_VALUES: how broadly a memory's declared triggers apply.
# "workspace" (default) is a true no-op — today's unfiltered behaviour.
# "repo" is currently a no-op identical to "workspace": true cross-worktree/
# cross-clone sharing needs the store keyed by git-common-dir instead of by
# workspace path, which is a larger storage change (see
# UPG-TRIGGER-SCOPE-REPO-CROSSSTORE); recorded faithfully at write time so the
# value round-trips once that lands. "session", "branch", and "path-subtree"
# are enforced (TRIGGER-ENGINE wave 2a, `scope_permits()` in
# agent/trigger_engine.py):
#   - "session": enforced in BOTH fire() and recall()/recall_for_path() —
#     an ephemeral note must never surface outside its writing session via
#     any path, not just trigger firing.
#   - "branch": enforced ONLY in fire() — bounds ambient trigger noise (a
#     branch-bound task stops nagging on the wrong branch); a deliberate
#     vectr_recall query is never blocked by branch, and this avoids a git
#     subprocess call on the hot, frequently-called plain recall() path.
#   - "path-subtree": enforced in fire() (against the note's declared
#     anchors[]) and in recall_for_path() (file_path is already a parameter
#     there — free); not enforced in the general query-based recall(), which
#     has no file context to filter against.
# Notes written before this wave carry scope="workspace" (the dataclass
# default) and are therefore unaffected — this is backward compatible.

# KIND_DEFAULT_SCOPES (UPG-TRIGGER-SCOPE-KIND-DEFAULTS, bm2-design-skeleton.md
# §1's Default bundles table): the scope a note gets WHEN ITS WRITE OMITS
# `scope` entirely (None) -- an explicitly passed scope (including explicit
# "workspace") always wins verbatim and never consults this table. Resolved
# and BAKED INTO THE ROW at write time by `WorkingContextStore.remember()`
# (unlike `default_bundle_for_kind()` in trigger_engine.py, which is
# deliberately evaluation-time so trigger-bundle changes apply
# retroactively -- scope is different: a note's scope is part of its
# identity/visibility contract, not a re-computable ranking input, so
# retroactivity is deliberately avoided here; a note written before this
# table existed keeps whatever scope it was actually written with). Only the
# two kinds the design skeleton's table assigns a non-default scope appear
# here; every other kind (including any future kind) keeps DEFAULT_SCOPE.
# Same rationale as VALID_KINDS/SCOPE_VALUES just above for living beside
# them as a plain constant rather than in config.yaml: this is a closed
# protocol mapping from the design doc, not an operator-tunable weight --
# there is nothing here for an operator to retune.

# PROVENANCE_VALUES: trust/endorsement class (bm2-design-skeleton.md §5),

# transcribed by an AI session from a direct user statement, with a verbatim
# excerpt of that statement MECHANICALLY bound to the note's content (see
# _user_quote.py) — never settable by a caller, only derived at write time by
# that deterministic check, so it is evidence rather than self-attestation.
# "agent" (default for vectr_remember) = an AI session recorded this; rendered
# as memory-to-verify. "auto" = captured by a mechanism with no reviewing
# judgment; weakest framing, and never allowed on kind="directive" (rejected
# at write time — an unreviewed standing rule is a contradiction in terms).

# is not a promotion target. Allowing promote(to="user-stated") would hand
