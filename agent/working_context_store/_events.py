"""
Note lifecycle event log (UPG-MEMORY-STATE-MACHINE).

A note's lifecycle is append-only: every transition — write, tombstone,
retraction, drift flag, revert, provenance bump — is recorded as one row in
`note_events` rather than mutated in place on the note itself. "Current
state" is never stored directly; it is always a fold over that log, so a
transition can be undone (`revoked` -> `reinstated`) by appending one more
event, never by rewriting history. `vectr_forget` remains the one true
hard-delete escape hatch — this log is for judgment calls that might be
wrong, not for a caller who genuinely wants the row gone.

NOTE_EVENT_KINDS is a closed protocol vocabulary — a caller either uses one
of these values or the write is rejected — not an operator-tunable
threshold, so it lives here as a plain constant rather than in
config.yaml (same reasoning already applied to VALID_KINDS/SCOPE_VALUES/
PROVENANCE_VALUES in _types.py).

Deliberately named NOTE_EVENT_KINDS, not EVENT_VALUES: `_types.py` already
exports an unrelated `EVENT_VALUES` (the trigger engine's E primitive —
session-start/prompt-submit/etc., "what lifecycle moment fired a trigger").
Reusing that name here for "what happened to a note" would be a genuine
collision between two different concepts that happen to share the word
"event" — this module picks a distinct name specifically to avoid it.

# Every lifecycle moment a note can pass through. `created` seeds the log at
# write time (redundant with the fold's own "active" default, kept so the
# log is a complete history with no implicit first row). `promoted` mirrors
# WorkingContextStore.promote()'s existing provenance step-up; it changes
# provenance, not lifecycle state, so the fold does not treat it as a
# state-changing event. `stale_flagged` is the one system-actor transition
# (deterministic anchor-drift, never a judgment call) and is likewise
# orthogonal to lifecycle state: staleness is re-derived fresh against live
# anchor hashes on every check_staleness() call (see that method), so a
# fixed anchor simply stops being flagged on the next check with no
# corresponding "un-stale" event needed — this is what makes it "automatic,
# reversible" per the design doc, as distinct from revoked/reinstated, whose
# reversal is always one more explicit event.

    `events` must already be ordered oldest-first by the log's monotonic
    `id` (SQLite AUTOINCREMENT) — NOT by `ts` (wall-clock `time.time()`),
    which can collide when two events land in the same low-resolution tick
    (e.g. a `contradicts=` write appending `created` on the new note and
    `revoked` on the target in the same call). `id` is strictly increasing
    and never collides, so it is the only reliable ordering for the fold's
    tie-break.

    A note with no events at all (pre-migration rows, or a caller that
    queries before any event was ever written) folds to "active" — the
    same default a brand-new `created` event would produce, so a missing
    log is never distinguishable from an intact one that just started
    "active" and hasn't moved.

    Returns the folded state plus the reason/actor/ts of the last
    state-changing event (None for all three when nothing has changed the
    note away from its initial "active" state) — the context anti-memory
    rendering needs (revoked date + reason) without a second query.
