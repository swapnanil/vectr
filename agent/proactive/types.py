# weakest tier among every candidate actually selected for one delivery, so
# a mixed-provenance block never overstates trust; a candidate with no
# recorded provenance (unset, or a non-note candidate such as code_semantic)
# looks itself up here via `.get(..., 0)` and lands at the weakest rank.
#
# "user-stated" (UPG-MEM-PROVENANCE-USER-STATED) ranks WITH "agent", not above
# it, matching `_types.PROMOTION_RANK`: the envelope describes who authored
# the text arriving on the wire, and that is still an AI session transcribing
# the user, so the agent-tier envelope is the honest one. Ranking it at

# TIEBREAK found 16/20 admitted weak-tier items were off-topic; reusing that
# tier for a deliberate declaration would launder a strong signal through a
