        `structural_only` (a static per-channel policy, never a content read)
        drops every semantic candidate — used by the high-frequency channels
        where only exact matches are cheap enough to be worth the budget.

        `record` (UPG-PROXY-APPEND-BURNS-COOLDOWN) controls whether SELECTION
        also CHARGES — i.e. writes the selected anchors into the cooldown
        `_ledger` and claims their note ids in `turn_ledger`. It defaults to
        True, which is retrieval-time charging: correct, and byte-identical to
        this method's historical behaviour, for any channel where retrieval IS
        delivery (the hook/trigger-engine surfaces, which see the packed result
        directly). The PROXY channel is the one place where it is not: the
        proxy retrieves over HTTP and only afterwards discovers whether the
        request body can actually carry the block. Charging there at selection
        spends a note's one cooldown slot on a request that may never receive
        it. Those callers pass `record=False` and charge later, on confirmed
        delivery (see `VectrService.proactive_context`).

        `record=False` changes ONLY the two write-backs. Every READ stays
        exactly as it is — the cooldown `seen()` filter in step 4 and the
        `turn_ledger.eligible()` filter in step 3 both still apply, so an
        uncharged selection is still suppressed by whatever WAS charged before
        it.

        `turn_ledger` (UPG-PROXY-CROSS-CHANNEL-DEDUP), if given, is the SAME
        per-session `TurnInjectionLedger` the hook/trigger-engine surfaces
        share (via the service's `_turn_ledger_for`) — ADDITIVE to, never a
        replacement for, this gate's own anchor-id cooldown `_ledger` below
        (which covers code-chunk candidates too, and provides cross-TURN
        cooldown this ledger does not). A note_id another surface already
        claimed this turn is dropped before packing; every note_id that
        SURVIVES the budget below is claimed here so a later surface this
        same turn will not re-inject it either — a note matched here but
        evicted for budget is deliberately left unclaimed, mirroring
        `WorkingContextStore.fire_and_format()`'s own turn-ledger contract.

        `edited_file_paths` (UPG-PROXY-INJECT-SINGLE-TURN) is this request's
        `ProactiveWindow.edited_file_paths` — the subset of the window's file
        paths a genuine edit-type tool call touched, as opposed to merely
        being read or mentioned. It governs EVENT-ANCHORED RETIREMENT, an
        exception to `record`'s plain "charge every selected item" rule that
        applies to exactly one case: a selected candidate whose
        `structural_tier` is `STRUCTURAL_TIER_DECLARED_ANCHOR` (a note's own
        declared anchor, the strongest structural evidence — the same
        evidence the hook channel's default pre-edit trigger bundle is built
        from, see `agent.trigger_engine.default_bundle_for_kind`) and whose
        `anchor_path` is NOT among `edited_file_paths` is delivered this
        turn same as any other selected item, but is EXCLUDED from the
        cooldown/turn-ledger write-back below — it stays eligible and may be
        selected again on a later request that still matches it, instead of
        retiring after one delivery (UPG-PROXY-INJECT-SINGLE-TURN's "too
        early, then evicted" failure: a note anchored to a file the agent has
        only read so far is not yet done being useful). The moment a request
        DOES show that file being edited, the same candidate is charged
        (retired) exactly like any other selected item. Every other
        candidate — every non-anchor structural tier, every semantic hit,
        every candidate whose `anchor_path` is unset — is charged on
        selection precisely as before this parameter existed; this is a pure
        narrowing of `record`'s scope, never a new class of unbounded
        delivery. `InjectionResult.unretired_anchor_ids` names exactly the
        anchor ids this call exempted, so a caller charging on a LATER
        confirmed-delivery (the proxy's deferred-charge path) can honor the
        same exemption instead of re-charging in full at confirm time.

        The envelope wrapping the packed block (UPG-PROXY-INJECT-ROLE-
        PROVENANCE) is chosen by `_envelope_open_for`, from the WEAKEST
        `Candidate.note_provenance` among `selected` — a mixed-provenance
        block always gets the most skeptical wording that applies to any
