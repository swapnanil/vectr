"""Matching engine for proactive context (UPG-PRO-4).

Given a `ProactiveWindow`, run every enabled matcher UNCONDITIONALLY and return
the union of scored `Candidate`s. No matcher branches on window *content* to
decide whether to run — which matchers are active is a static config toggle,
never a runtime read of the conversation (the no-query-heuristics hard rule).

The matchers do not implement retrieval themselves; they call a `MatchSource`,
which the daemon backs with the existing recall / path-anchor / search paths.
The honest shipped subset is:
  M1 structural_note  — exact file-path -> anchored/mentioning note (tiered score)
  M3 semantic_note    — cosine note recall above the similarity floor
  M4 code_semantic    — hybrid code search (opt-in; needs a built index)
M2 (symbol-definition via locate) is defined by the design but deferred here;
adding it is another matcher + threshold, not a content classifier.

Every rendered note line also carries a provenance/trust marker (UPG-PROXY-
INJECT-ROLE-PROVENANCE, `_provenance_label()` below) so a note that escapes
the outer envelope (agent/proactive/gate.py) — truncation, a model that skims
— still self-describes as recalled memory of a given trust class rather than
reading as an instruction. `ProactiveMatcher` can additionally be told to
drop `kind == "directive"` notes entirely before they ever become a
`Candidate` (`exclude_directive_notes`) — see that flag's own docstring for
why this belongs here rather than in the gate.

    which measurement (LANE-UTILITY-2, injection_utility benchmark) showed
    produced a title-shaped, actionless injected line for every real note
    that had one.

    `title` and `content` are distinct stored fields (a short index-tier
    LABEL vs. the BODY — see `WorkingNote`'s own field comments), so this

      - no title: the body alone (unchanged from before for the common

    """Return (window_file_path, display_label, is_declared_anchor) for the
    first window file this note is actually about.

    UPG-PROXY-SUBSTRING-ANCHOR/2b: the note's DECLARED `anchors` column is
    checked first — an exact match there is the strongest signal, and the
    caller may honestly say "anchored to X". Only when no declared anchor
    matches does this fall back to a boundary-matched content mention,
    using the SAME `_path_boundary_match()` rule `recall_for_path()` uses
    (shared, not forked) — the caller must render that case as "mentions
    X", a materially weaker provenance claim than "anchored to X". Returns
    None when the note is about none of the window's files.

    The window file path (`anchors` dict's key, not its basename value) is
    returned alongside the display label so `match()` can carry it onto the
    STRUCTURAL_TIER_DECLARED_ANCHOR `Candidate.anchor_path` (UPG-PROXY-
    INJECT-SINGLE-TURN) — the gate needs the exact path to test membership
    against a request's `edited_file_paths`; the basename alone is not
    enough to do that safely."""
