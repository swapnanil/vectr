"""vectr bundled-config loader.

Reads ``agent/config.yaml`` at import time and caches the results.  All paths
are resolved via ``importlib.resources`` so this works both when running from
the repository root *and* when vectr is installed as the global binary
(``/opt/homebrew/bin/vectr`` or similar pip install), where a ``cwd``-relative
``open()`` would fail.

Public API
----------
QUALITY_TRIVIAL : float
    Quality prior for bare stub chunks (UPG-12.1).

QUALITY_NAVIGATIONAL : float
    Quality prior for re-export / import-only navigational chunks (UPG-12.1).

QUALITY_NAV_DECLARATION_RESCUE : float
    Softened quality prior for a bare-constructor-manifest navigational chunk
    when the query lexically names one of the identifiers it declares
    (UPG-NAV-OVERDEMOTE-DECL / F59). Applied instead of QUALITY_NAVIGATIONAL
    only for that lexically-gated case; every other query still gets the full
    navigational demotion.

QUALITY_HEADING_ONLY : float
    Quality prior for markdown heading-only chunks (UPG-12.1).

QUALITY_GENERATED : float
    Quality prior for machine-generated files (UPG-12.1).

QUALITY_VECTR_CONFIG : float
    Quality prior for vectr's own config files (UPG-12.1).

QUALITY_TEST_DEPRIORITISED : float
    Quality prior for test files (UPG-12.1).

TEST_FRAMEWORK_FAN_IN_THRESHOLD : int
    Minimum unambiguous corpus-wide caller-file count (symbol_graph.file_fan_in())
    above which a test-path-classified file is exempted from
    QUALITY_TEST_DEPRIORITISED (UPG-TESTPATH-FRAMEWORK-MISCLASS / F58) — it is a
    shipped testing-framework subpackage, not disposable test code.

QUALITY_DOC_PROSE : float
    Quality prior for documentation prose chunks (UPG-12.1).

QUALITY_SHORT_PENALTY : float
    Quality prior for chunks with very few meaningful lines (UPG-12.1).

QUALITY_PRIVATE_SYMBOL : float
    Quality prior for a private/internal symbol (single leading underscore,
    not a dunder) — a language-general naming convention, not corpus- or
    query-specific (UPG-16.1 / F30).

TRIVIAL_DOC_MAX_LINES : int
    Maximum non-blank lines for an HTML/markup or plain-text chunk to be
    classified as trivial by is_trivial_chunk() (UPG-15.5). 1–2-line test
    fixture templates and egg-info TXT files are trivial; multi-line .rst/.txt
    docs are not affected.

RERANK_TOP_K : int
    Number of hybrid candidates to rerank before trimming to n_results (UPG-12.1).

RERANK_TOP_K_UNFILTERED : int
    Deeper candidate pool for unfiltered (no language filter) queries (UPG-12.1).

RERANK_PRE_FILTER_FETCH_K : int
    Over-fetch depth for the pool-entry trivial filter (UPG-15.7). The hybrid
    retrieval fetches this many raw candidates, drops trivial (non-forced) chunks
    via is_trivial_chunk(), then trims to top_k_unfiltered before the cross-encoder
    runs. Ensures the rerank pool is filled with real code on fixture-heavy corpora.

INDEXING_MAX_CHUNK_LINES : int
    Hard cap on lines per chunk — prevents single huge chunks diluting embeddings (UPG-12.1).

INDEXING_CLASS_HEADER_LINES : int
    Lines kept for class-level chunk (sig + docstring + attrs) (UPG-12.1).

OUTPUT_SNIPPET_LINES : int
    Lines returned as a snippet with each symbol location (UPG-12.1).

BEHAVIOR_REMEMBER_NUDGE_THRESHOLD : int
    Tool calls without vectr_remember before a nudge fires (UPG-12.1).

BEHAVIOR_REMEMBER_NUDGE_COOLDOWN : int
    Calls between repeated nudges after the threshold first fires (UPG-12.1).

EVICTION_RETRIEVED_TOKEN_GATE : int
    Minimum accumulated retrieved-token estimate since the last auto-eviction hint
    before auto_eviction_hint() will emit. Suppresses the hint on bursts of tiny
    searches that contribute negligible context pressure (UPG-11.15).

EVICTION_HINT_MAX_IDS : int
    Maximum chunk ids listed as re-fetch keys in eviction_hint()'s render
    (UPG-EVICT-SESSION-SCOPE).

EVICTION_MAX_TRACKED_SESSIONS : int
    Maximum concurrent per-session EvictionAdvisor instances tracked by a
    daemon before the oldest is dropped (LRU) (UPG-EVICT-SESSION-SCOPE).

EVICTION_REMEMBER_ESCALATION_CHUNKS : int
    Chunks retrieved since the caller's last vectr_remember before
    auto_eviction_hint()'s escalated ACTION REQUIRED directive fires again
    (UPG-REMEMBER-BANNER-FATIGUE).

EVICTION_REMEMBER_ESCALATION_TOKENS : int
    Tokens retrieved since the caller's last vectr_remember required IN ADDITION
    to EVICTION_REMEMBER_ESCALATION_CHUNKS before the escalated directive fires
    again — a companion gate so one large single search cannot trip both the
    chunk-count and token gates in a single burst (UPG-EVICT-ESCALATION-GATE-TOO-LOW).

BOOT_MAX_DIRECTIVE_NOTES : int
    Maximum directive notes returned by boot_recall() (UPG-9.2). Directives
    are ordered oldest-first (standing rules stay in a stable order).

BOOT_MAX_TASK_NOTES : int
    Maximum high-priority task notes returned by boot_recall() (UPG-9.2),
    ordered newest-first (UPG-TASK-NOTE-INJECTION-RECENCY): task notes are
    current-work state, so the boot set surfaces only the freshest
    checkpoints rather than the full task history.

RESUME_MAX_GOTCHAS : int
    Maximum open (non-superseded) kind="gotcha" notes returned by
    resume_state() (UPG-RESUME-SURFACE), newest first. The task-note and
    snapshot sections of `resume` reuse BOOT_MAX_TASK_NOTES and the
    snapshots table's own "latest" selection respectively — this is the one
    new bound resume introduces.

INGEST_TRACES_MAX_UNRESOLVED_EXAMPLES : int
    Maximum unresolved caller/callee example strings surfaced in the
    vectr_ingest_traces response (UPG-7.3). Edges are ingested regardless;
    this only bounds the warning text length.

SYMBOL_NAME_PARAM_ALIASES : tuple[str, ...]
    Alternate argument keys accepted in place of "name" on vectr_locate and
    vectr_trace (F40-class ergonomics). A tool-description example that reads
    positional trains callers to guess a wrong key; the dispatch layer accepts
    these as drop-in aliases so the call succeeds instead of erroring.

MEMORY_HYGIENE_STALE_TASK_WARN_COUNT : int
    Minimum number of live kind="task" notes older than
    MEMORY_HYGIENE_STALE_TASK_WARN_AGE_DAYS before vectr_status appends a
    stale-task nudge (UPG-TASK-SUPERSEDES-HYGIENE). Additive/state-based only
    — never mutates or expires notes.

MEMORY_HYGIENE_STALE_TASK_WARN_AGE_DAYS : int
    Age in days after which a kind="task" note counts toward the stale count
    above (UPG-TASK-SUPERSEDES-HYGIENE).

LOCATE_LARGE_SPAN_THRESHOLD : int
    Line-span (end_line - start_line) at or above which a located symbol is
    considered "large" — typically a canonical library class or function (UPG-15.10).
    Symbols with span >= this value get the best (lowest) span bucket in locate
    ranking, so canonical 1000+ line base classes rank before tiny test stubs.

LOCATE_SMALL_SPAN_THRESHOLD : int
    Line-span below which a located symbol is considered "tiny" — a stub or inner
    test class (UPG-15.10). Symbols with span < this value get the worst (highest)
    span bucket in locate ranking, penalising 2–5-line test-inner stub classes.

IMPORTANCE_PRIOR_LAMBDA : float
    Blend weight for the file-level PageRank importance prior in the final search
    sort (ARCH-1b): final_score = base_rerank_score * quality_score * (1 + lambda *
    importance). 0 disables (pre-ARCH-1b behaviour). Relevance-gated by the multiply
    against base_rerank_score.

CLASS_IMPORTANCE_PRIOR_LAMBDA : float
    Blend weight for the class-level reference-frequency importance prior in the
    final search sort (ARCH-2), composed with IMPORTANCE_PRIOR_LAMBDA:
    final_score = base_rerank_score * quality_score * (1 + lambda_file * file_imp)
    * (1 + lambda_class * class_imp). 0 disables (pre-ARCH-2 behaviour). The lever
    that discriminates same-leaf method collisions file-level importance cannot.

PURPOSE_RANK_PRIOR_LAMBDA : float
    Blend weight for the ARCH-4 dual-vector purpose-similarity prior in the final
    search sort (ARCH-4b), composed with the two priors above: final_score =
    base_rerank_score * quality_score * (1 + lambda_file * file_imp) * (1 +
    lambda_class * class_imp) * (1 + lambda_purpose * purpose_sim). purpose_sim is
    the chunk's own body-vs-purpose cosine similarity (0 when no purpose vector
    exists for the chunk). 0 disables (pre-ARCH-4b behaviour). Carries the ARCH-4
    pool-entry signal into the final rank, which the body-only cross-encoder
    rerank cannot see.

TYPE_DEF_PRIOR_LAMBDA : float
    Blend weight for the type-definition node_type prior in the final search
    sort (UPG-RUST-DEF-EVICTION / DEF-B), composed with the three priors
    above: final_score = ... * (1 + lambda_purpose * purpose_sim *
    quality_score) * (1 + lambda_def * is_type_definition). is_type_definition
    is 1 when the chunk's own node_type is a struct/enum/trait/class/interface
    definition (chunk_quality.is_type_definition_chunk), else 0. 0 disables
    (pre-DEF-B behaviour). The lever that keeps a canonical type definition
    from losing to a same-name test/usage site at comparable rerank score.

DOCSTRING_DEDUP_LINES : int
    Leading docstring/comment lines compared when computing the near-duplicate
    docstring dedup key (UPG-RUST-DEF-EVICTION / DEF-C).

DOCSTRING_DEDUP_MIN_CHARS : int
    Minimum normalized leading-docstring length (chars) below which a chunk is
    never folded by the docstring dedup key — chunks with a trivial or absent
    leading header keep every occurrence (UPG-RUST-DEF-EVICTION / DEF-C).

INDEXING_FLOW_SCAN_HEAD_BYTES : int
    Bytes scanned from the start of a `.js` file when detecting Flow type syntax
    (UPG-JSFLOW-SYMBOLS). A header scan, not a full-file walk.

INDEXING_FLOW_PRAGMA : str
    Primary Flow-detection signal — the `@flow` pragma (UPG-JSFLOW-SYMBOLS).

INDEXING_FLOW_SECONDARY_MARKERS : tuple[str, ...]
    Secondary Flow-detection signals — Flow-only import syntax (UPG-JSFLOW-SYMBOLS).

SYMBOL_GRAPH_RESERVED_KEYWORDS : dict[str, frozenset[str]]
    Per-language keyword sets that must never be minted as a symbol name or
    call-edge target — guards against a desynced/ERROR-node parse misattributing
    a keyword token as an identifier (UPG-JSFLOW-SYMBOLS).

SYMBOL_GRAPH_ERROR_RECOVERY_MIN_SPAN_LINES : int
    Minimum line-span an opaque errored (non-symbol-type) node must cover before
    an isolated reparse-recovery attempt is made on its byte range
    (UPG-REACT-TSX-FUNCTION-DECL-DROP).

SYMBOL_GRAPH_ERROR_RECOVERY_MAX_REPARSE_ATTEMPTS : int
    Reparse-recovery attempts budget per file, bounding worst-case parse cost
    (UPG-REACT-TSX-FUNCTION-DECL-DROP).

SYMBOL_GRAPH_ERROR_RECOVERY_MAX_EXTEND_STEPS_PER_ATTEMPT : int
    Per-attempt cap on sibling-absorption steps while growing a reparse past
    a mid-declaration cut, so one badly-cut region can't burn the whole
    per-file reparse budget (UPG-REACT-TSX-FUNCTION-DECL-DROP).

SYMBOL_GRAPH_TRACE_QUALIFIER_NEARMISS_MAX : int
    Maximum nearest-real-qualified-name suggestions surfaced by `trace()` when
    a "Class.method" qualifier fails to resolve to a real definition
    (UPG-TRACE-CALLERS-QUALIFIER-VALIDATION).

SYMBOL_GRAPH_QUALIFIED_NEARMISS_CANDIDATE_CAP : int
    Cap on exact-leaf-name candidates pulled before `nearest_symbol_names`
    ranks them by qualifier/enclosing-type similarity, when a "Class.method"
    qualifier fails to resolve under every `locate_l2` strategy
    (UPG-LOCATE-FALLBACK-NO-SIMILARITY).

WORKSPACE_DEFAULT_VECTRIGNORE_DIRS : tuple[str, ...]
    Directory names seeded into a fresh .vectrignore on first `vectr start`/`vectr
    init` when the workspace has none yet (UPG-13.2). Never overwrites an existing
    .vectrignore.

WATCHER_TOP_LEVEL_RESCAN_INTERVAL_S : float
    Seconds between CodeWatcher's shallow top-level-only rescans, used to pick up
    new top-level directories/files since the watcher never watches the workspace
    root itself (UPG-13.1/13.3).

WATCHER_BURST_FILES_THRESHOLD : int
    Distinct paths pending per-file debounce simultaneously above which
    CodeWatcher cancels every per-file timer and collapses into one deferred
    batch re-index (UPG-WATCHER-PRESSURE-GOVERNOR) — bounds embed-pipeline
    load under a sustained multi-file edit stream.

WATCHER_BURST_QUIET_SECONDS : float
    Seconds of repo-wide silence required, once burst coalescing has started,
    before the collapsed batch actually runs (UPG-WATCHER-PRESSURE-GOVERNOR).

WATCHER_MAX_RSS_MB : float
    Self-limit (MB) on this process's own peak resident set size above which
    a watcher-triggered batch re-index is deferred to the next quiet window
    instead of run (UPG-WATCHER-PRESSURE-GOVERNOR). 0 disables the check.

HOOKS_LOG_INJECTIONS : bool
    When true, every hook-driven recall that actually injects notes appends
    one line to ~/.vectr/logs/<workspace-hash>.hooks.log (UPG-HOOK-INJECT-
    OBSERVABILITY). Off by default — the per-hook-kind counters in `vectr
    status` cover the common case without writing to disk.

HOOKS_LOG_CHARS_PER_TOKEN : int
    Divisor for the approximate token count written to the optional hook
    injection log above (UPG-HOOK-INJECT-OBSERVABILITY).

HOOKS_MIN_SIMILARITY : float
    Per-turn UserPromptSubmit recall relevance floor (UPG-9.5). Raised from
    0.35 to 0.72 (adversarial-review measurement, 2026-07-15): at 0.35 the
    hook injected 3 irrelevant notes on 8/8 deliberately off-topic prompts;
    the M trigger primitive's own per-kind thetas (0.72-0.80) had 0/8 false
    fires on the identical prompts.

HOOKS_COMMIT_NOTE_MAX_FILES : int
    Display cap on the file list a commit-provenance note shows verbatim
    (UPG-COMMIT-MEMORY-HOOK) — files beyond this count collapse into "+N
    more".

HOOKS_COMMIT_NOTE_MAX_SUBJECT_CHARS : int
    Hard cap on a commit-provenance note's subject-line length
    (UPG-COMMIT-MEMORY-HOOK).

HOOKS_POST_COMMIT_TIMEOUT_S : float
    Hard timeout (seconds) the post-commit git hook's own daemon HTTP call
    (POST /v1/commit-note) is held to (UPG-COMMIT-MEMORY-HOOK) — defense in
    depth behind the hook's own shell-level backgrounding, which is what
    actually keeps `git commit` from ever waiting on it.

STRATEGY_DEFAULT_SEMANTIC_WEIGHT : float
STRATEGY_DEFAULT_BM25_WEIGHT : float
    Fallback hybrid-search weights used before the first index-time codebase
    fingerprint has run (UPG-8.2). Keeps `search` and `status` deterministic
    from the first call instead of the weight fields being silently absent.
DUAL_VECTOR_ENABLED : bool
    Master switch for the ARCH-4 per-symbol purpose-vector pool-entry mechanism.
    True stores + queries a second body-stripped "purpose" embedding (qualified
    signature + docstring) per symbol chunk. False reduces to pre-ARCH-4
    body-only behaviour.

DUAL_VECTOR_BLEND_MODE : str
    How a chunk's body and purpose similarity scores combine into one dense
    score: "max" (default, non-averaging pool-entry rescue) or "weighted".

DUAL_VECTOR_BLEND_WEIGHT : float
    Purpose-vector weight when DUAL_VECTOR_BLEND_MODE == "weighted".

DUAL_VECTOR_MAX_SIGNATURE_LINES : int
    Maximum declaration lines captured when distilling a chunk's purpose text.

DUAL_VECTOR_MAX_DOCSTRING_LINES : int
    Maximum docstring/leading-comment lines captured when distilling a chunk's
    purpose text.

DUAL_VECTOR_MAX_DOCSTRING_CHARS : int
    Maximum characters kept from the captured docstring/leading-comment text.

NOTFOUND_FLOOR_ENABLED : bool
    Master switch for the UPG-NOTFOUND-FLOOR low-confidence signal (F46).
    False is an exact no-op: low_confidence is always False, restoring
    pre-UPG-NOTFOUND-FLOOR behaviour.

NOTFOUND_FLOOR_MIN_TOKEN_LEN : int
    Minimum length (chars) for a query token to be considered a content word
    in the zero-document-frequency check (UPG-NOTFOUND-FLOOR-2).

NOTFOUND_FLOOR_STOPWORDS : frozenset[str]
    Generic English/query-scaffolding words excluded from the zero-document-
    frequency check.

NOTFOUND_FLOOR_MIN_ZERO_DF_TOKENS : int
    Minimum number of query content tokens with zero corpus-wide document
    frequency (i.e. the token never appears in ANY indexed chunk, not just
    the query's fetched candidate pool) required to flag a search's result
    set low_confidence. Replaces the absolute-cosine floor (dense_score_floor)
    of the first UPG-NOTFOUND-FLOOR iteration, which measurement showed
    cannot separate absent-topic from on-topic queries against the
    production embedder — see config.yaml for the evidence.

NOTFOUND_FLOOR_MIN_TOP_RELEVANCE : float
    Absolute floor (UPG-SCORE-DISPLAY-FLAT) on the top result's cross-encoder
    relevance score (ce_relevance): below this, low_confidence is flagged
    even if the zero-document-frequency check above doesn't trip. Never
    applied to the raw dense-cosine fallback score — see config.yaml for why.

NOTFOUND_FLOOR_CE_OVERRIDE_MIN_RELEVANCE : float
    UPG-NOTFOUND-FLOOR-CE-OVERRIDE. High-confidence override on the
    zero-document-frequency trigger: when the top result's cross-encoder
    relevance (ce_relevance) is >= this value, the zero-DF trigger is
    suppressed (an everyday paraphrase of a symbol the corpus contains can
    lack a corpus vocabulary word yet still match decisively — 0.988
    observed). A threshold comparison on an already-computed calibrated
    score, never the raw dense-cosine fallback. The low_top_relevance
    sub-signal is unaffected. Set above 1.0 to disable (no ce_relevance can
    meet it) — an exact no-op restoring the pre-override OR behaviour.

NOTFOUND_FLOOR_BANNER : str
    Low-confidence banner text prepended to the MCP vectr_search response
    when the floor fires.

NOTFOUND_FLOOR_BANNER_CLI : str
    Low-confidence banner text printed by `vectr search` (CLI surface) when
    the floor fires (UPG-CLI-SEARCH-FLOOR). Separate from the MCP banner
    above because that text names `vectr_locate`, meaningless at a shell
    prompt — no `vectr locate` subcommand exists.

EMBEDDING_DEFAULT_MODEL : str
    Default local (sentence-transformers) embedding model for the L3 content
    index (UPG-EMBEDDER-SWAP-GRANITE). A workspace's ChromaDB collection is
    stamped with whichever model built it (CodeIndexer's embed-model stamp);
    changing this value forces a full vector index rebuild on next index
    rather than mixing vectors from two models in one collection.

EMBEDDING_THREAD_CAP : int
    Resolved CPU thread cap applied to the local (torch-backed) embedding
    model at construction (UPG-EMBED-THREAD-CONTENTION) — `embedding.
    thread_cap` verbatim if positive, else `embedding.thread_cap_auto_fraction`
    of `os.cpu_count()` (minimum 1) when that key is 0. Governs the
    process-wide torch thread pool, so it also caps the cross-encoder
    reranker.

FETCH_MAX_IDS_PER_CALL : int
    Maximum chunk ids accepted per vectr_fetch / POST /v1/fetch / `vectr
    fetch` call (UPG-CTX-EVICT). Bounds the deterministic re-fetch-by-id
    surface so it can't be used as an unbounded bulk export of the index.

ARC_NORM_UUID_REGEX, ARC_NORM_VERSION_REGEX, ARC_NORM_NUM_REGEX,
ARC_NORM_PATH_EXTENSION_REGEX : str
    Positional-argument abstraction-class regexes used by app/cmdnorm.py
    (L1 capture design doc §3.1, LANE-ARC). Comparison-only classification
    of argv structure — concrete values are always preserved alongside.

ARC_NORM_ENV_ASSIGNMENT_REGEX : str
    Matches a leading `NAME=value` env-var-assignment prefix token on a
    Bash command (§3.1) — its name is captured, the token is stripped.

ARC_NORM_STDERR_MERGE_TOKEN : str
    Trailing redirect token stripped from the first pipeline stage
    (`cmd 2>&1 | tail -30` -> `cmd`) — §3.1 semantics-neutral decoration.

ARC_NORM_MAX_VERB_TOKENS : int
    Maximum leading tokens folded into a normalized command's `verb`
    (binary + immediate subcommand chain, e.g. `npm run build`) — bounds
    runaway absorption of positional arguments into the verb for commands
    with no flags (e.g. `cp src dest`).

ARC_SIMILARITY_VERB_WEIGHT, ARC_SIMILARITY_FLAG_WEIGHT,
ARC_SIMILARITY_ARG_WEIGHT : float
    Composite mutation-similarity weights (L1 capture design doc §3.2,
    LANE-ARC): score = verb_weight*verb + flag_weight*jaccard(flags) +
    arg_weight*jaccard(args). Sum to 1.0.

ARC_SIMILARITY_VERB_SOFT_MATCH_MIN_RATIO : float
    Levenshtein ratio above which two non-identical verbs count as a soft
    match (typo-fix verbs) rather than unrelated (§3.2).

ARC_SIMILARITY_VERB_SOFT_MATCH_SCORE : float
    Fixed verb-component score assigned to a soft verb match (§3.2) —
    not the raw Levenshtein ratio.

ARC_MUTATION_BAND_MIN, ARC_MUTATION_BAND_MAX : float
    Composite-similarity band a candidate failure->success pair must fall
    in to count as a mutation arc (§3.2). A score of 1.0 (identical
    normalized command) is never a mutation — it routes to the
    edit-mediated/flaky check (§3.4) instead.

ARC_WINDOW_MAX_COMMANDS : int
    Sliding-window bound (§3.3): a pending failure or edit record ages out
    once more than this many Bash/Edit episodes have since been observed
    in the session.

ARC_WINDOW_TTL_SECONDS : float
    Sliding-window bound (§3.3): a pending failure or edit record ages out
    once this many seconds have elapsed (by episode timestamp, never wall
    clock) since it was observed.

ARC_WINDOW_MAX_PENDING_PER_VERB_FAMILY : int
    Cap on concurrently pending failures tracked per (session, verb-family)
    bucket (§3.3) — the oldest is evicted once a new failure exceeds it.

ARC_FLAKE_SUPPRESS_MIN_COUNT : int
    Number of proven flaky-retry flips (identical command, no intervening
    edit, no env/cwd delta) for the same normalized command within a
    session before near-threshold mutation-band matches for that command
    are suppressed too (§3.4, Travis-CI base-rate defense).

ARC_FLAKE_NEAR_THRESHOLD_MIN : float
    Lower bound of the "near-identical" similarity sub-band subject to the
    flaky-suppression rule above (§3.4) — a genuinely different mutation
    at a lower score is never suppressed by this rule.

ARC_TRANSIENT_MARKER_IDS : frozenset[str]
    Marker ids (tool-output classification — see agent/markers.yaml, owned
    by LANE-EPISODE) that mark a captured arc `low_confidence` (§3.5(b)):
    the failure's stderr matched a transient-error signature, so the "fix"
    may just be an environment retry rather than a real one.
