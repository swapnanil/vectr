        Streaming, same shape as index_workspace's Phase 3 (UPG-INDEX-MEM-
        STREAMING): `build_purpose_text` is called per _EMBED_BATCH_SIZE
        batch of `chunks` (not once up front for the whole corpus), and each

        `all_embeddings`/`documents`/`metadatas` were still live in the
        caller's frame — the two full-corpus embedding lists held concurrently
        were the dominant swap driver on large workspaces.

        mid-way through it, whether inline or on the deferred background
        thread) simply leaves that file's purpose vectors missing/partial;
        nothing here can corrupt or falsely mark content as incomplete, and
